# hello-world
An attempt to understand github !

I'm one of the many structural engineers who like to code. I just started learning Github with a hope of organizing my work and life. As of now, I'm following Github's online tutorial to make myself famililar with the platform. 

PS: This is the first ever change to my master file.
